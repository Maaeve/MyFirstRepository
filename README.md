# MyFirstRepository
This is my first repository for testing purposes to learn Git
And this line is my first commit, but with a first try 20-02-2021.

Test for correct push 20-02 11:43.

Next test for a change in the code. 11:46

Total reset 20-02 13:51. 

This line was developed while issue1 was under development for the second time.

This is a second new branch. Feel free to experiment here.

This is a brand new branch where we'll experiment a lot.

This is the new branch for the ThirdTrial. Hopefully this will work.
